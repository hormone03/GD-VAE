### GD-VAE: Generalized Dirichlet Variational Autoencoder
This repository contains the implementation of [A topic modeling and image classification framework: The Generalized Dirichlet variational autoencoder](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320323007343), see schematic diagram below. Note that some of the codes in the textScript are taken from (https://github.com/sophieburkhardt/dirichlet-vae-topic-models). The Generalized Dirichlet distribution leverages rejection sampling variational inference using a reparameterization trick for effective training. We first applied the proposed model on text, see the [texScripts folder](https://github.com/hormone03/GD-VAE/tree/master/textScripts). We further validate the algorithm on image classification.
